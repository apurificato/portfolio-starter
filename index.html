                <h1>I am a Developer</h1>
                <h3>And I build cool stuff. Contact me for projects.</h3>
                <p>I come from a relatively diverse professional and educational background, which I believe has strengthened my skills and positioning in the market as a developer and web designer. In college, I was a Writing minor and took various courses that strengthened my ability to write, which translated well into marketing and copywriting tasks during my career.</p>
                <p>After earning my Bachelor's of Arts degree in Psychology at Rutgers University, I worked at a creative agency for about 3 years as a Digital Content & Media Specialist. In this role, I gained invaluable experience publishing content on websites and working within various Content Management Systems such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, MailChimp, and Campaign Monitor.</p>
                <p>While working, I decided that I needed to go further and learn web development, challenging myself to gain new skills. This led to me completing a Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp.com and enrolling in a Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp at Rutgers (currently completing).</p>
